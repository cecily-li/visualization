# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Good Visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g/viz/HRAttritionDashboardRWFD_16570446563570/viz
        This visualization is not accessible to those who are visually impaired, as its muted colours, small text size, and low contrast in some sections such as the survey score makes it difficult to read even to the visually-abled. This data visualization may be reproducible if the dataset were to be obtained, but is difficult in the sense that there may have been multiple sources consulted to build out the different attribute tables. This data visualization does appear to be equitable as it utilizes data such as role, department, salary, and survey results in addition to gender, age, and education. 



        Bad Visualization: https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-01-21-kl.-16.31.07.png
        This data visualization is accessible in the sense that it employs bold colours and contrast, but is difficult to interpret at a glance. The reproducibility is contingent on a couple of factors such as whether the text was applied as an overlay in an editor such as Photoshop or added as part of the visual using something like Python. Additionally, there are rounding techniques applied that are not detailed so while the replication can get close to what was achieved, it will be difficult to replicate at a higher degree of accuracy. The data visualization is not equitable because it misrepresents the market cap of each company due to the nature of the figure type selected. 


        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Good: Increase the size of the visual so that the font sizes can be increased, and change the colour contrasts on areas such as the survey score results by darkening the orange and strategically alternating between white/black text. To go above and beyond, provide a short summary of the data visualization that the visually impaired can refer to. 
        
        Bad: Make the colours more muted, and (assuming the text was added as an overlay over the original figure) use Python or another visualization tool to add in and position text in order to enhance reproducibility. Add axes labels and consider doing a side by side comparison of the different market competitors instead of the stacked approach currently being displayed. 




        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:

# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      
      Bad: https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-01-21-kl.-16.31.07.png
      
       - Percentages don‚Äôt add to 100% due to rounding, which may make the presentation skewed, however slightly. Additionally, there is no information about the type of rounding used that causes this. 
       - The x-axis and y-axis don‚Äôt have labels, the user of the graph must make the connection themselves. Users who are not familiar with this style of presentation for ‚Äúyear‚Äù on the x-axis may misread or misinterpret the graph. 
       - The revenue share is confusing when depicted against the y-axis scale of 0% to 100%. For example, Blackberry is recorded as having <1% market share, however it is presented at the top of the graph with some areas surpassing the y-axis ‚Äú100%‚Äù gridline. At a glance, this may indicate to the user of this visual that Blackberry currently dominates the market, which is the complete opposite of what the visual is actually portraying. Conversely, the actual market dominator, Apple, is at the bottom of the graph and at a glance appears to hold the least market share. 
       - The overall colour choices make the visual cacophonous, and while it causes the visual to pop, it is visually displeasing.

      - There is a clear theme throughout this dashboard which makes it easy to read and discern between different data points. This allows the user to quickly and easily pick up the point that the visual is trying to get across without need for much additional effort from the user‚Äôs side.
      - When hovering over specific areas in the visuals, there is additional information that comes up to further elaborate on what the data is portraying. This allows the user to make better-informed decisions or draw more informed conclusions. 
      - The dashboard is interactive, allowing the user to manipulate the presentation of data based on preset indicators such as different periods, IDs, etc. The customization allows the user to better curate this dashboard and access data that is more customized to their particular needs.
      - There is a clear indication of the time period from which this data was gathered, which allows the user to draw a conclusion for a specific start and end period.
      - There is a summary at the top of the dashboard which presents the overall key values from the data.
      - There is an option to show only ‚Äúattrition‚Äù, or both ‚Äúretention‚Äù and ‚Äúattrition‚Äù (default setting). This allows the user to view ‚Äúattrition‚Äù data without interference and/or biases caused by additional, irrelevant background data.




      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Bad: 
      - The creator of this visualization for global smartphone market share could have selected a different type of visual, such as a pie chart, which can still be used to portray the significant lead Apple and Samsung have over the competition while being visually representative of actual market share.
      - More complimentary colours could have been selected, or the visual could have been arranged in a way where the colours are not so jumbled and, as a result, jarring to the viewer.
      - More information could have been provided regarding the rounding, including a breakdown of which data points caused the overage beyond 100%
      - The x and y axes should be labelled to prevent confusion to the user, and the visual depicted in a way that allows the user to more easily gather information and make an accurate conclusion at a glance (although this may have been intentional to guide the reader of this WSJ article to spend more time pondering/taking in the information) 

      
      Good:
      - The bar graph y-axis and x-axis could have been labelled to provide further clarity to the user
      - Some of the data points could have been represented as percentage breakdowns in addition to the current presentation of data to allow ease of use and better depict trends across data
      -  The colour legend on the Survey Score could have been presented under the visual as it may be inconvenient for the user to hover over the "i" button each time they wish to see/better understand the colour breakdown. Additionally, some users may not realize that this is a feature and miss it, taking away from the clarity of the visual.






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
